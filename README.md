Date::Names
===========

Module **Date::Names** - Provides month and day-of-the-week names for numbers (multilingual)

SYNOPSIS
========

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

The module's hashes are no longer exported in order to avoid interference with the user's environment.
But the **@lang** array is still exported.

### VERSION 1

~~~perl6
use Date::Names; # <== note no :ALL

# For one-off use
say "Month 3 in Dutch is '{%Date::Names::mon<nl><3>}'";
say "Month 3 in English is '{%Date::Names::mon<3>}' or '{%Date::Names::mon<en><3>}'";
say "Weekday 3 in Italian is '{%Date::Names::dow<it><3>}'";
say "Two-letter abbrev. of weekday 3 in German is '{%Date::Names::dow2<de><3>}'";
say "Three-letter abbrev. of weekday 3 in English is '{%Date::Names::dow3<en><3>}'";

# For more intense cases, one can use this syntax:
my %dow = %Date::Names::dow<nl>; # a convenience hash
say "Weekdays in Dutch:";
for 1..7 -> $n {
    say "  day $n: {%dow{$n}}";
}
~~~

### VERSION 2

The direct access to the hashes has changed, and the new syntax is shown here.
Notice there are two ways to do it.

~~~perl6
use Date::Names;
my %dow = %($Date::Names::de::mon);
say "key $_" for %dow.keys.sort; # 1..7
my $dow = $Date::Names::de::mon;
say "key $_" for $dow.keys.sort; # 1..7
~~~

DESCRIPTION
===========

Module **Date::Names** provides the full name of months and days of the week for
the numbers 1..12 and 1..7, respectively, primarily for use with
**Perl 6**'s date functions.

Full names of the months and weekdays are currently available in the
following languages:

### Table 1. Language two-letter ISO codes (lower-case)

  Language           | ISO code
  :---               | :---:
  Dutch              | nl
  English            | en
  French             | fr
  German             | de
  Italian            | it
  Norwegian (Bokm√•l) | nb
  Russian            | ru
  Spanish            | es

CAPITALIZATION AND PUNCTUATION
==============================

All English month and weekday names are always capitalized.
Other languages vary in capitalization depending on where
the word or abbreviation is used or other factors. The
names and abbreviations herein are in the most common form,
but the user can always explicitly set the case by applying
the Perl 6 routines **tc**, **uc**, or **lc** to the name or
abbreviation.

Some of the abbreviations include an ending period since that is
customary use in some languages (e.g., French).

LIMITATIONS
===========

Not all languages have a complete set of two- and three-letter
abbreviations, and some require up to four letters for the official
abbreviations.

Table 2 shows the hash names for the abbreviations
currently available. Hash names with a 2 or 3 appended are complete
abbreviation sets of that length only.  Hash names with an 'a'
appended are sets of abbreviations of mixed length.  A 'Y' in a cell
indicates a language has a complete set of that type of abbreviation.

Note that in some countries the term "abbreviation" is distinctly
different than "code" as applies to date names. An asterisk in a cell
marks those which are technically codes rather than abbreviations.
Table 3 shows the meaning of other codes used in the Table 2 cells.

### Table 2. Name hash availability by language

Language / Hash | mon2 | mon3 | mona | dow2 | dow3 | dowa
---      | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
Dutch    |       |   Y   |       |   Y   |   Y   |
English  |       |   Y   |       |   Y   |   Y   |
French   |   Y*  |       |   Y   |       |   Y   |   Y
German   |       |   Y   |       |   Y   |       |
Italian  |       |       |       |       |       |
Norwegian|       |       |       |       |       |
Russian  |       |   Y   |       |   Y   |       |   Y
Spanish  |       |   Y*  |       |   Y   |   Y*  |

### Table 3. Name hash cell codes and meaning

Code | Meaning
---  | ---
\*    | code rather than an abbreviation
Y    | language has this hash
U    | hash values are upper-case
M    | hash values are mixed case
L    | hash values are lower-case
T    | hash values are title-case
P    | hash values have a trailing period


PULL REQUESTS
=============

Native language speakers please submit PRs to (1) complete the
existing language abbreviations, (2), correct errors, and (3) provide
more languages.

CORRECTIONS & SUGGESTIONS
=========================

The goal of this module is to be useful to non-English users as well
as English users. The author welcomes suggestions for improvement and
increased utility.

VERSION 2 PLANS
===============

In work now is a class to ease use of the module:

```perl6
perl6
use Date::Names;
my $dn = Date::Names.new(
    :lang<en>,
    :day-hash<dow2>,
    :mon-hash<mon3>,
);
is $dn.dow(1), "Mo";  # ok
is $dn.mon(1), "Jan"; # ok

```

The basic class is working and is tested briefly.  More is to be done,
but eventually it will be able to proved a unified handling of full
names and abbreviations. The user will be able to control casing,
absence or presence of periods on abbreviations, and truncation or
padding as desired.
